Senescent immune cells within the tumor microenvironment

 Preliminary data describe in silico tracking of senescent-like immune cells in human NSCLC. Briefly in order to identify senescent-like immune cells we first conducted an analysis of four gene sets (associated with Replicative Senescence (RS), Ras-Induced- Senescence (RIS), Oncogene-Induced-Senescence (OIS) and Oxidative Stress (OS) induced Senescence) and  ended up with a senescence gene signature. Details for the various datasets used are provided in the "datasets_used_for_the_senescence_gene_markers_analysis.xlsx". The flowchart of the analysis can be examined with the pdf schematic "pipeline_for_deciphering_overall_senescent_markers.pdf". The pdf describes the scoring system as obtained per NGS data-set for each gene which was used for the ranking and prioterisation of each gene relative to its ascosciation with senescence. This scoring was perfomed for each of the senescent stimuli where in order to determine overall senescent markers, we obtained an overlap of the highest ranking genes for each senescent stimuli.  Thus we determined 14 hallmark senescence-associated markers and the senescence signature was subsequently applied onto a scRNA-seq (Kim et al, 2020) and a TCRseq (Guo et al, 2018) database to track senescent-like immune cell as can be seen from the "senescence_immune_cell-type_analysis.pdf". The T cell populations were found to contain the highest percentage of senescent cells and therefore we focused on them. A UMAP visualising T cell subtypes as distinct populations with colour annotations has been concluded which demonstrates different T cell subclusters presenting significant abundance of senescent cells in NSCLC tumours (compared to respective normal tissue), these are highlighted by dashed lines. Senescent populations within T cell clusters highlighted at the UMAP display normal tissue vs lung tumors (*P<0.05 of Studentâ€™s t test). We provide notebooks with the basic analysis followed for the scRNA-seq data.
